# Port Scanner Programs
Overview:
This repository contains two port scanner programs, one designed for Unix-like systems and the other for Windows. 
Both programs demonstrate how to utilize socket programming and concurrent execution to efficiently scan multiple ports on a target host.

Unix System Port Scanner:
 The Unix-like system port scanner uses POSIX socket APIs and C++11 threading to perform asynchronous port scans.
 This program showcases skills in network programming, multithreading, and modern C++ techniques
KEY FEATURES:
- asynch port scanning
- timeout handling
- error handling

Win Port Scanner:
The Windows port scanner leverages the Windows Sockets API (Winsock) to scan ports on a target host. It demonstrates the use of non-blocking sockets and the select function to handle asynchronous connections.
This program highlights proficiency in Windows-specific networking APIs and concurrency handling.
KEY FEATURES:
- non-blocking sockets
- winsock API
- interactive scanning 
# Cool things about these programs:
- Concurrency and Performance: Both programs utilize asynchronous techniques to scan multiple ports concurrently, making them fast and efficient. This demonstrates a strong understanding of concurrent programming and performance optimization.
- Cross-Platform Skills: The repository includes implementations for both Unix-like systems and Windows, showcasing versatility in handling platform-specific networking APIs.
- Practical Application: Port scanning is a fundamental technique in network security and penetration testing, making these programs highly relevant for cybersecurity professionals.
- Socket Programming: These programs illustrate foundational knowledge in socket programming, which is crucial for developing networked applications.
